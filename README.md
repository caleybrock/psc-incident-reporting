## Demo
Fake emails were sent through an email service.

Demo included a [Figma App](https://www.figma.com/proto/KcYSDKLUn4j9baXSIJwSYCzb/Untitled?node-id=1%3A16&scaling=contain&redirected=1) for the day of testing interface.

Forms open from emails and Figma App.

## Tech
Forms generated from [pForm](http://www.phpform.org/) and modified to have government styles.

Responsive email forms forked from leemunroe's [responsive html email template](https://github.com/leemunroe/responsive-html-email-template).
